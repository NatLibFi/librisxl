# TRLD

For standard JSON-LD operations, and for the implementation of Target
Vocabulary Maps, we include a copy of the java sources generated by the
[TRLD](https://github.com/niklasl/trld) library (available under a
0BSD-license, thus free to copy and use without restrictions).

You can regenerate and update this copy by running the sequence in `update.sh`.
